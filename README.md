The program is a representation of a ticket machine. The user has 4 initial options:  
0 - it simply exits the program  
1 - you can buy a ticket with this option, but to do so, you have to pick another option.  
This time you choose what kind of ticket you want to get.  
Next step is to pick, if you want to add another ticket to your "cart" or move to paying.  
Then you decide what payment method do you want. Paying by card is obviously a boring one, since it only completes your transaction, so let's talk about paying in cash.  
We have many choices here. Typical ticket machine in Cracow accepts six kinds of Polish nominals. We have to insert proper amount of money here. And don't worry, if you inserted too much, you will get your change back. Also, if you inserted some coins and you decided not to buy a ticket, machine will give you back the same coins.  
2 - it returns amount and income from all kinds of tickets for all dates  
3 - it returns tickets, which were bought on a certain date, which you have to insert in format: dd-mm-yyyy
